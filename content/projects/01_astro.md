Took this project from zero to a published app on Google Play. I started by researching the app market to find niches that seemed the most profitable. Analyzed various data points (like revenue/downloads data provided by SensorTower). Landed on astrology apps. Then designed the architecture and led the build from start to finish.

Along the way, I found and managed two external contractors — a designer and a junior developer — mentoring the junior along the process.

On the technical side, I integrated Google Pay for payments and AdMob for ads, making sure the monetization felt smooth.

The app's Play Store account has since been removed, but the project remains a solid example of owning a product end-to-end.
